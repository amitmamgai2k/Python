üêç Core Features of Python
Simple and Easy to Learn

Python has a clear and readable syntax similar to English, making it accessible to beginners.

Interpreted Language

Python is executed line-by-line, which helps with debugging and simplifies development.

Dynamically Typed

You don‚Äôt need to declare variable types explicitly. Python automatically infers them.

Object-Oriented

Supports object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts like classes, inheritance, and encapsulation.

Extensive Standard Library

Comes with a rich set of modules and functions for everything from file I/O to regular expressions and networking.

Cross-Platform Compatibility

Python code can run on any operating system with minimal or no modification.

Large Community and Ecosystem

Huge community support and a vast collection of third-party libraries and frameworks (e.g., Django, Flask, NumPy, Pandas).

Integrated with Other Languages

Python can be integrated with C, C++, Java, and .NET components.

üî• Advanced Features
Automatic Memory Management

Python has a built-in garbage collector for automatic memory management.

Functional Programming Support

Includes features like map(), filter(), lambda functions, and list comprehensions.

Interactive Mode

Python can be run in an interactive shell (REPL), making it great for testing and experimenting.

Embeddable and Extensible

Python can be embedded into C/C++ programs, or extended with C/C++ code.

Versatile Usage

Used in web development, automation, data analysis, AI/ML, IoT, game development, and more.
